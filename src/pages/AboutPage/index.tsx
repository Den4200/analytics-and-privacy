        I am a student living in the United States studying Computer Science, aspiring to be a
        software engineer. I work a lot with user data, both where I volunteer and in my personal
        endeavors. Privacy is something very important to me and the people I work with.

      <p className="text-lg mb-8">
        Not only do I work with data at Python Discord, I also do so in personal endeavors. For
        example, my friends and I chat in our own Discord server, where I collect metrics on them
        and their messages sent. A few graphs of the data collected were shown on the homepage.
        It's quite interesting to see our messaging habits in each channel during different hours
        of the day, which channel is most popular, who talks the most in each channel, etc. We have
        gained a lot of insight into what happens around the server.
